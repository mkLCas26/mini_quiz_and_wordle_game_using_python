<h1 align=center> Mini Games: Quiz and Wordle </h1> 

<p> The game consists of a five (5) item geography quiz and a wordle game that has 15 words categorized into three: fruits, animals, and countries. This was programmed using the Python Language. Possible and
recommended improvement of this program would be utilizing a GUI. Moreover, this was a work of 4 student programmers for their final lab project.</p>
